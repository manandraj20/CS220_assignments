Asynchronous: always block has poserade reset and reset not only works at jumps in clock
synchronous: remove the reset from always block

UCF(user constraint file)

Device: XC35500E
Package: FG320
Speed: -5
Family: SPARTAN3E

2 cables from FPGA to PC: one for power and other for detecting FPGA

D flip-flop: reset=1 then output is 0 regardless of input.

Write iverlog code -> synthesize-> Implementatiom (require UCF) -> gererate bit file
write iverilog code ->simulation (with test bench)-> check correctness

FPGA-> only works with flip flops and not with the gates

Project:
1. Name the project
2. set the specifications correctly (device, package, speed, family)
3. create a full_adder iverilog module
4. No need to specify ports for module
CODE: 
module full_adder (a,b, cin,s, cout):
input a,b, cin;
output s,cout;
assign (cout,s)=a+b+cin;
5.Attach structural file to define the structure of adder (2 xor, or and and)

Note: lookup table is a memory which stores the output. It depends on the number of input rather than the depth of circuit

6. Add the UCF file
7. Imlement the design
8.
